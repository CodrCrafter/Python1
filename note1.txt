Output statements:-
in python we can display the output by using print statements.
print statements is in 4 different types:
1)Double quots
eg:print("hello")
2)Single quots
eg:print('hello')
3)Triple quots
egprint("""hello""")
4)Triple single quot
eg:print('''hello''')

*In python hash is used for single line comment.
Few multiple line comment
Conditional statements are used to check the condition for every condition there will be a 2 possibilities i.e True or False
If condition is true,it is going to execute immediate statements of if condition
If condition is false, it will excute else part.
*To work with conditional statement if and loop are introduced.
  1)if:It is used to check condition which takes a parameter as condition.
    if the condition is true ,immediate statements will be exicuted.
    if the condition is false,it will exicuted else part.

if(condition):
    true code
else:
    false code

EXAMPLES:-
---------

1)Write a program to find even or odd.

num=int(input("enter the value")
if(num%2==0)
  print("even")
else:
  print("odd")

2)write a prg to read 2 num & find greatest of number.

a=int(input("enter the number")
b=int(input("enter the number")
if(a>b)
 print("a is greater")
else:
 print("b is greater")

3)write prg to read marks from user & display the results w.r.t the marks.

m=int(input("enter the marks")
if(m>=35):
 print("pass")
elif(m>50 and m<60):
 print("first class")
elif(m>60 and m<75)
 print("second class")
elif(m>75 and m<100):
 print("distinction")
else:
 print("fail")

4)write prg to read a num & check is it divisible by 3 and 5

num=int(input("enter the number")
if(num%3==0)
 print("divisible by 3")
else:
 print("not divisible by 3")
if(num%5==0)
  print("divisible by 5")
else:
  print("not divisible by 5")

5)write prg to read a num & display following messages
*if the num divides by 3 ,display hi
*if the num divides by 5 ,display hello
*if the num divides by 3&5 ,display hi & hello

num=int(input("enter the number")
if(num%3==0)
 print("hi)
elif(num%5==0)
 print("hello")
elif(num%3==0 and num%5==0)
 print("hi hello")

6)write a prg to read age from user & check is the user is elligible for voting.

age=int(input("enter age")
if(age>=18)
  print("elligible")
else:
  print("not elligible")

7)write prg to read 4 numbers & find greatest & lowest num.

Loops:To repeate the same statements again & again loops are used.
